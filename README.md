![Melee Scoreboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seylumva/melee-scoreboard/master/concept/melee-scoreboard-concept.png)

A score board for Super Smash Bros. Melee, to be used in conjunction with Open Broadcaster Software with some form of website display, such as CLR Browser for OBS and OBS Studio.

Keep in mind that I am only using this project in order to learn new technologies that may come to be a necessity in order to complete this project so development will not be as swift or may be incomplete for an indefinite amount of time.

**Features:**
- Integration with HTML setup that is used with CLR Browser on OBS
- Allows for custom team logos
- Provides tools for tournament organizers to make their own scoreboards personalized

**Future Plans:**
- Import the configuration interface into JavaFX
