The background will be provided to tournament organizers to change background, logo (might add feature to add from configuration).
The rest of the information will be manipulated from the client that will update a local HTML/CSS/JS website to be used with CLR Browser.

My target users for this scoreboard are local tournaments as larger production streams ran like VGBC and GGS probably already have a
similar, and likely better solution to this realtime stat updating.
I'm trying to provide a lightweight solution for tournaments to have a central hub where all information is updated simultaneously
with a reasonable amount of customizability left to the tournament organizers to add for their own needs.
